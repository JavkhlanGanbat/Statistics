# Introduction

This document is a reusable template for analytical reports in Quarto.
It supports citations like Roback and Legler @roback2021beyond and Schober et al. @schober2018.
You can also use custom macros from the header like \myterm{term} and \mybox{Hello from a macro!}.

We will reference Equation @eq-logreg, Figure @fig-sine, and Table @tbl-sample as examples.

# Methods

## Model

We use logistic regression to model binary outcomes:

$$
P(y=1\mid x)=\sigma(w^\top x + b)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(w^\top x + b)}}
$$ {#eq-logreg}

For correlated features, interpret coefficients carefully; see @schober2018 for guidance on correlation.

## Data

Example data dictionary:

| Variable         | Type     | Description                         |
|:-----------------|:---------|:------------------------------------|
| age              | numeric  | Age in years                        |
| educational-num  | numeric  | Years of education                  |
| hours-per-week   | numeric  | Weekly work hours                   |
| workclass        | category | Employment type                     |
| income_>50K      | binary   | 1 if income > 50K, else 0           |

# Results

## Example Figure

```{python}
#| label: fig-sine
#| fig-cap: "Sample figure demonstrating a simple sine wave."
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 300)
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), color="#2E86AB", lw=2)
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("sin(x)")
plt.title("Sine Wave")
plt.grid(alpha=0.3)
```

## Example Table

```{python}
#| label: tbl-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample data table created in Python."
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({
  "Metric": ["Accuracy", "Precision", "Recall", "F1"],
  "Score":  [0.85, 0.79, 0.72, 0.75]
})
df
```

We refer to Figure @fig-sine and Table @tbl-sample for demonstration.

# Discussion

- Quarto enables reproducible, documented analysis with code and narrative.
- Equations like @eq-logreg are first-class citizens alongside figures and tables.
- Use citations such as @roback2021beyond to anchor methods in literature.

# Conclusion

This template can be cloned for new reports. Replace text, update references, and embed your analysis code.

# Appendix

## Additional Math

A simple linear model:

$$
y = X\beta + \varepsilon
$$ {#eq-ols}

Refer to Equation @eq-ols in text.

## Re-usable Blocks

- Use sections and sub-sections to structure content.
- Add callouts, code-folding, and filters as needed.
- Keep references in references.bib and cite with `@key`.
